## üöÄ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites for Unreal-MCP Setup
This **Unreal AI** integration requires the Model Context Protocol setup. Please refer to the [MCP official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user) for comprehensive details.


### 1. Download Claude for Desktop

Download Claude for Desktop (choose either macOS or Windows).

Note: Linux is not yet supported for Claude for Desktop.


Follow the installation instructions.
If you already have Claude for Desktop, make sure it's on the latest version by clicking on the Claude menu on your computer and selecting "Check for Updates‚Ä¶"

### 2. Install from Fab

After downloading the Unreal-MCPython plugin on Fab, find the plugin in your Library in the Epic Games Launcher.
Click "Install to Engine" and choose the appropriate version of Unreal Engine (5.6 or higher).

### 3. Install unreal-mcp-server

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/genorca/unreal-mcp-server.git
cd unreal-mcp-server
```
Ensure you have Python 3.11+ and uv installed.

### 4. Configure Claude for Desktop

1. Open the Claude menu on your computer and select "Settings‚Ä¶"
    - Note: These are not the Claude Account Settings found in the app window itself.

2. Click on "Developer" in the left-hand bar of the Settings pane, and then click on "Edit Config".
3. This will create a configuration file at:
    - Windows: %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json

4. Open the configuration file in any text editor and replace the file contents with:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "unreal-mcpython": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\unreal-mcp-server",
                "run",
                "src/unreal_mcp/main.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
Replace with the actual absolute path to your unreal-mcp-server folder.

### 5. Configure Unreal Engine

1. Create a new Unreal Engine project or load an existing project.
2. From the "Edit" menu, select "Plugins".
3. Enable these plugins: Unreal-MCPython and Python Editor Script Plugin.
4. Restart Unreal Engine.

### 6. Connect with Claude

1. Restart Claude for Desktop.
2. The MCP server will start automatically in the background.
3. Upon restarting, you should see a slider icon in the bottom left corner of the input box.
4. Click the slider icon to view and connect to available Unreal Engine tools.
5. Select the "unreal-mcpython" server to connect.
6. You can now ask Claude to perform automation tasks in your project using the UE Python API.



# üîç Usage Examples
## Basic Unreal AI Commands
```
"Create 10 trees randomly placed on the terrain surface"  
```

### Troubleshooting

- MCP server not starting: Verify that Python 3.11+ and uv are properly installed.
- Path errors: Ensure the absolute path in the configuration file is correct.
- Plugin not visible: Restart Unreal Engine and verify the plugins are enabled.
- Slider icon not visible: Completely restart Claude for Desktop and verify the configuration file was saved correctly.
